# Cledge Shell
  Cledge Shell is a program that allows you to perform actions using commands. It exists only for Windows and is programmed in Batch, the simplest and most intuitive Microsoft language. With Cledge, every action is simplified and made more intuitive.

For now, Cledge Shell supports only a few shares, but over time their number will increase exponentially.

Its installer places the executable file inside the System32 folder, without which it could not work. Just type "cledge" in the command prompt, and the shell will start.
