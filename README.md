# Cledge Shell

##  What Cledge Shell is?
  Cledge Shell **is a program that allows you to perform actions using commands**. It exists **only for Windows** and is programmed in Batch, the simplest and most intuitive Microsoft language. **With Cledge, every action is simplified and made more intuitive**.

For now, Cledge Shell supports only a few commands, but over time their number will increase exponentially.

Its installer places the executable file inside the System32 folder, without which it could not work. **Just type "cledge" in the command prompt, and the shell will start**.

For any information, you can **contact us at** swiftdevlabs@gmail.com
